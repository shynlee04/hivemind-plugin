## Key Composition Patterns

### Permission Cascading
Global config → Agent config → Session overrides → Runtime approvals. Last matching rule wins via `findLast()`.

### Tool Hook Pipeline
1. Plugin `tool.execute.before` → mutates args
2. Agent permission check (ctx.ask()) → can block
3. Tool execute → actual logic
4. Plugin `tool.execute.after` → mutates output

### Agent-Skill Two-Phase Loading
Phase 1: Skill names+descriptions in system prompt (auto)
Phase 2: Full SKILL.md content loaded on-demand via skill tool

### Subtask Spawning
Commands with subtask:true create SubtaskPart → child session → inherits target agent config + restricted tools (no task, no todowrite by default)
