<objective>
Generate unit and E2E tests for a completed phase, using its SUMMARY.md, CONTEXT.md, and VERIFICATION.md as specifications.

Analyzes implementation files, classifies them into TDD (unit), E2E (browser), or Skip categories, presents a test plan for user approval, then generates tests following RED-GREEN conventions.

Output: Test files committed with message `test(phase-{N}): add unit and E2E tests from add-tests command`
