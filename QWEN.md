# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

## IMPORTANT UPDATE TO ALL AGENTS

- ALL AGENTS MUST ANNOUNCE THIS EVERY TURN DEPENDING ON MAIN-HUMAN-FACING ORCHESTRATOR OR SUBAGENT BEING DELEGATED

- IF you are a front-facing -> you will mostly delegate **Everytime Delegation** in the prompt YOU MUST LET the subagent know that IT IS THE SUBAGENT BY ANNOUNCING: *You are the subagent Name:XXX role...., you must do as this prompt instructed and knowing that you are being delegated

- As subagent you must anounce your roles so the skills must also match. Say: I am **subagent, I can't delegate further, and I must fulfill my work. If need verification, I will return the verification needed in the report handoff


<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

This override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **Superpowers skills** — override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.


HiveMind V3 is a **runtime composition engine** for OpenCode. It is an npm package (`opencode-harness`) that provides tools, hooks, and a plugin for delegated session orchestration, continuity persistence, concurrency control, and runtime guardrails.

**This is NOT a skill-pack project.** Skills are one component. The product is the harness: a TypeScript plugin that wires tools + hooks into OpenCode with zero business logic in the plugin layer.

### Two Halves (never confuse them)

| Half | What | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| **Hard Harness** (npm package) | Tools (write-side), Hooks (read-side), Plugin (assembly), Shared (leaf) | `src/` |
| **Soft Meta-Concepts** (user-configurable) | Skills, Agents, Commands, Rules, Permissions | `.opencode/` |

### Runtime features this project delivers

Background agents, auto-loop/ralph-loop, delegation chain with task persistence, task queuing, category system, session recovery. See `docs/draft/architecture-proposal-hivemind-v3.md` for feature-to-code mapping.

## Setup Commands

```bash
npm install                    # Install dependencies
npm run build                  # Clean + compile TypeScript to dist/

```

### Dependency rules (non-negotiable)

- `types.ts` is leaf — depends on nothing
- `helpers.ts`, `concurrency.ts`, `completion-detector.ts` — leaf or near-leaf
- `lifecycle-manager.ts` depends on most modules (deepest chain: 2 levels)
- No circular dependencies
- Max module size: 500 LOC

### Where to find things

| Task | File |
|------|------|
| Change session persistence format | `src/lib/continuity.ts` |
| Add a lifecycle phase | `src/lib/types.ts` + `src/lib/lifecycle-manager.ts` |
| Change SDK call patterns | `src/lib/session-api.ts` |
| Change concurrency model | `src/lib/concurrency.ts` |
| Change completion detection | `src/lib/completion-detector.ts` |
| Change task status transitions | `src/lib/task-status.ts` |
| Change agent config (temperature, tools) | `src/plugin.ts` — `AGENT_DEFAULTS`, `AGENT_TOOLS` |
| Change circuit breaker / tool budget | `src/plugin.ts` — `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`, `MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_SESSION` |

## Testing Instructions

- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run single test file: `npx vitest run tests/lib/helpers.test.ts`
- Run tests matching pattern: `npx vitest run -t "<test name>"`
- Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage` — covers `src/**/*.ts`, excludes `src/index.ts`
- Test files live in `tests/lib/` — mirror `src/lib/` structure
- Tests use vitest globals (no imports needed for `describe`, `it`, `expect`)
- **Type-check before committing:** `npm run typecheck`

---

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode (`strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noImplicitReturns`)
- ES2022 target, NodeNext module resolution
- `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` — use `import type` for type-only imports
- Deep-clone-on-read in continuity store
- `[Harness]` prefix on all thrown errors
- Dual-layer state: durable JSON file (`continuity.ts`) + in-memory Maps (`state.ts`)
- No `any` types on new code
- Max module size: 500 LOC

---

## Build and Deployment

- Build: `npm run build` — compiles `src/` → `dist/` with declarations + source maps
- Package entrypoints:
  - `opencode-harness` → `./dist/index.js`
  - `opencode-harness/plugin` → `./dist/plugin.js`
- Prepack runs build automatically: `npm pack` / `npm publish`
- Runtime state path: `.opencode/state/opencode-harness/` (outside package source)

---

## OpenCode Integration

- Plugin loaded via `.opencode/plugins/harness-control-plane.ts` (thin wrapper re-exporting `dist/`)
- Config: `opencode.json` at repo root — references `AGENTS.md` as instructions
- 6 agents defined in `.opencode/agents/`: coordinator, conductor, researcher, builder, critic, explore
- 5 skills in `.opencode/skills/`: meta-builder, user-intent-interactive-loop, coordinating-loop, planning-with-files, use-authoring-skills
- 6 commands in `.opencode/commands/`: start-work, plan, deep-init, deep-research-synthesis-repomix, harness-doctor, ultrawork

---

## Architecture Rules (from architecture-proposal-hivemind-v3.md)

### Script rule
A script should **REPORT FACTS** and **LEAVE JUDGMENT TO THE AGENT**. Pure helpers only (exit 0, no governance). No hardcoded paths, no state mutation outside CQRS tools.

### Anti-patterns to avoid
- Static `.md` files acting as agent definitions (they are templates/references only)
- Bash scripts outside `bin/` CLI substrate
- Governance scripts that block progression (facts only)
- Feature bloat: keep modules under 500 LOC, total codebase target ~4,000-5,000 LOC
- Skill proliferation: target ~20 SKILL.md files, not hundreds

### Target architecture (from proposal)
5 tools (~500 LOC total), hooks (~800 LOC), lifecycle (~400 LOC), delegation (~400 LOC), continuity (~400 LOC), CLI substrate (~500 LOC), control-plane (~400 LOC), shared (~800 LOC).

---

## Git Commit Discipline

- Commit message format: `phase: what changed — why it matters`
- Commit after each meaningful change (subagent returns, phase completes, gate passes)
- Never accumulate changes across multiple phases without committing
- Agents may only manage commits for their own work — they do not constrain or override commits from other development activity

---

## Terminology

| Use | Not |
|-----|-----|
| Harness | Framework, system |
| Agent (specialist: researcher/builder/critic) | Claude, AI, model |
| Skill | Prompt, instruction |
| Runtime composition | Static definition |
| Delegation packet | Task assignment |

## Qwen Added Memories
- Background delegation debugging session (2026-04-09): Root cause was using session.prompt() (synchronous) instead of session.promptAsync() for background tasks. Child sessions were deleted when parent's turn ended. Fix: use promptAsync() endpoint. Also fixed: agent routing (added "general" to VALID_AGENTS), async design (tool description tells LLM to continue working), completion notifications with link+brief+duration, offline notification persistence via pending-notifications.ts, and tmux/OpenClaw style execution mode classification.
