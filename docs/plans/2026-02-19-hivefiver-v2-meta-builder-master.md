# HiveFiver v2 Meta Builder - Master Plan

## Objective
Deliver a production-ready HiveFiver v2 meta-builder with:
- root command model (`/hivefiver <action>`)
- tri-persona routing
- MCP-first evidence governance
- chat-first tutoring UX
- deterministic export/traceability contracts

## Scope
- Core and limited expansions only.
- Operational blueprints for non-dev domains.
- No mandatory external API runtime executors.

## Locked Decisions
1. Dual-layer command compatibility.
2. Chat-first UX.
3. 10-attempt validation loops.
4. Process guarantee only.

## Deliverables
- Updated source integration and task model.
- Command, workflow, agent, and skill packs.
- MCP setup playbooks.
- Verification + inventory reports.
