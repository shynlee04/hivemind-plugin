# HiveFiver Phase 0 - Source Normalization

## Objective
Normalize command and agent source-of-truth to root asset directories.

## Actions
1. Reconciled command drift by promoting missing `.opencode/commands/*` files into `commands/*`.
2. Reconciled agent drift by promoting `explore.md` and `scanner.md` into `agents/*`.
3. Preserved `sync-assets` mechanism for deterministic propagation.
4. Confirmed current sync behavior for `skills/` copies `SKILL.md` files only; nested `references/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/` stay canonical in repo source.

## Validation Targets
- Root command set must contain all operational command docs.
- Root agent set must contain all active subagent contracts.
- No new command should be authored directly in `.opencode/`.

## Exit Criteria
- Canonical source is root assets.
- `.opencode/*` can be fully regenerated by sync.
