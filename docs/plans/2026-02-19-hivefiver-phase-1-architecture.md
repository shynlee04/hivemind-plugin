# HiveFiver Phase 1 - Architecture Contract

## Objective
Define decision-complete architecture for a dual-persona meta builder.

## Core Contracts
- Lifecycle: Idea -> Vision -> Spec -> Clarification -> Research -> Plan -> Task Graph -> Handoff
- Two-lane routing: vibecoder and enterprise
- Domain lanes: dev, marketing, finance, office-ops, hybrid
- Process guarantee: only after all evidence gates pass
- Context-shaping policy informed by DeepWiki SDK findings

## Lane Behavior
### Vibecoder
- multiple-choice guided intake
- explanation-first output
- hidden TDD controls

### Enterprise
- strict ambiguity controls
- mandatory evidence triangulation
- hard blocking on unresolved high-risk constraints

## Non-goals (v1)
- No new TypeScript runtime tools/hooks required
- No plugin mutation ownership changes
