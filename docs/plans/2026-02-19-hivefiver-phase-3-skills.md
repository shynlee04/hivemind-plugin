# HiveFiver Phase 3 - Skill Pack

## Skills Added
1. `hivefiver-persona-routing`
2. `hivefiver-spec-distillation`
3. `hivefiver-mcp-research-loop`
4. `hivefiver-gsd-compat`
5. `hivefiver-ralph-tasking`
6. `hivefiver-bilingual-tutor`
7. `hivefiver-skill-auditor`

## Packaging Pattern
Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` (trigger + workflow)
- `references/*` (domain details)
- `templates/*` (reusable output forms)
- `scripts/*` (deterministic helpers)

## Hardening Additions
- Cross-domain coverage for dev, marketing, finance, office-ops, and web research lanes.
- MCP readiness and confidence scripts.
- Ralph conversion scripts (`todo-to-prd-json`, enhanced schema validator).
- External skill catalog discovery guidance (Skill.sh) with trust-first adoption policy.

## Outcome
Skill system is now phase-mapped and reusable for both user extremes.
