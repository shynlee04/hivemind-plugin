## Production-Ready Execution Tracker (Master Plan)

This section is the live implementation tracker used while hardening `master`.

### Scope
- Convert validated findings into code + tests (no shallow/doc-only closure).
- Prioritize security and reliability first, then maintainability and test debt.
- Keep this tracker updated per iteration.

### Iteration Status

| Iteration | Focus | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| I0 | Baseline validation and synthesis | ✅ Done | Team A + Team B reconciled at HEAD |
| I1 | P0 security hardening (`safeJoin` + manifest path safety) | ✅ Done | Implemented across paths/planning/migration with dedicated traversal tests |
| I2 | P0 persistence observability (`withState` backup logging) | ✅ Done | Added non-silent backup failure warning + regression test |
| I3 | P1 config constants consolidation + validator alignment | ✅ Done | Restored exported constants, aligned validators, CLI uses centralized constants |
| I4 | P1 prompt-generation regression suite | ✅ Done | Added `tests/agent-behavior-prompt.test.ts` matrix + edge coverage |
| I5 | Full production gate (`npm test`, typecheck, boundary lint) | ✅ Done | All verification commands green on current branch |
| I6 | Terminology hardening + legacy compatibility | ✅ Done | Removed deprecated automation label from public surface while preserving legacy input normalization |
| I7 | P2 persistence backup cleanup observability | ✅ Done | Added warning logs for old-backup cleanup failures and deterministic backup ordering with regression coverage |

### Acceptance Gate for "Production-Ready"
1. All P0 items implemented with tests.
2. Full test suite green + typecheck + boundary lint.
3. No known path traversal vectors in session-path resolution.
4. Persistence backup failures are observable in all critical write paths.
5. Configuration validation has a single source of truth and regression tests.
6. Deprecated/offensive automation label removed from public schema and CLI UX.
7. Backup cleanup failures are observable (non-fatal) during save operations.

## Methodology

### Verification Approach
1. Read all 6 PR diff files (pr8, pr11, pr14, pr15, pr16, pr17)
2. Verified git log of 30 commits on current branch
3. Independently grepped/searched every file touched by Jules PRs at HEAD
4. Read all existing team reports (Team A: 4 files, Team C: 12+ files, Judge: 1 file, Research: 5 files)

### Scoring Model (5 dimensions)
| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Diff Quality** | 30% | Is the PR's code change technically sound? |
| **HEAD Retention** | 25% | Does the change survive at current HEAD? |
| **Ecosystem Fit** | 20% | Does it integrate with project architecture? |
| **Risk Profile** | 15% | Security/reliability/regression risk |
| **Practical Value** | 10% | Real-world impact for this plugin's scale |

## Key Finding: The 28f6c3d Consolidation

All 14 Jules PRs were historically merged. However, commit `28f6c3d` ("Rename deprecated label → coach + brownfield scan") reshaped/reverted most of them. **Only 2 of 14 PRs have functional artifacts surviving at HEAD.** This aligns with Team A (previous) and contradicts Team C's assumption that PRs exist as-merged.

---

## Independent HEAD Verification Summary

| PR | File(s) | Claimed | HEAD Reality | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #4 | hierarchy-tree.ts:422 | Iterative DFS | Recursive (`result.push(...flattenTree(child))`) | **REVERTED** |
| #5 | schemas/brain-state.ts | `migrateBrainState` extraction | No function in any src/ file | **REVERTED** |
| #6 | hierarchy-tree.ts:585,616 | Unified `renderNode` helper | **Local** `renderNode` in both `toAsciiTree` and `toActiveMdBody` — separate, not unified | **PARTIALLY EXISTS** ★ |
| #7 | tests/ | SDK Context test suite | `sdk-foundation.test.ts` covers singleton lifecycle | **FUNCTIONALLY RETAINED** |
| #8 | schemas/config.ts | Exported const arrays | Only `DEFAULT_AGENT_BEHAVIOR` + `DEFAULT_CONFIG`; no `GOVERNANCE_MODES` etc. | **REVERTED** |
| #9 | tools/ | `CliFormatter` class | No trace in src/ | **REVERTED** |
| #10 | lib/persistence.ts:250 | Backup failure logging | `logger?.warn(...)` exists in save path; backup deletion errors still silent | **PARTIAL** |
| #11 | lib/persistence.ts:77,109 | Async `FileHandle` lock | Still `openSync`/`closeSync` | **REVERTED** |
| #12 | lib/planning-fs.ts:324-328 | `basename()` sanitization | No `basename` import; raw `stamp` in joins | **REVERTED** |
| #13 | tests/ | Agent behavior prompt tests | No `agent-behavior.test.ts` exists | **REVERTED** |
| #14 | lib/persistence.ts:38 | `Promise.all` concurrent | Sequential `for` loop | **REVERTED** |
| #15 | lib/persistence.ts | `fs.copyFile` | No `copyFile` import; still `readFile`+`writeFile` | **REVERTED** |
| #16 | lib/detection.ts:508 | Extract to `src/utils/string.ts` | Local function in detection.ts; no `src/utils/` dir | **REVERTED** |
| #17 | hooks/ | Extract to `session-lifecycle-helpers.ts` | No helpers file; no helpers import in session-lifecycle.ts | **REVERTED** |

**★ Unique finding**: PR #6's `renderNode` was reported as "completely missing" by all three prior analyses (Team A, Team C, Judge). I found it EXISTS as local functions but is NOT the unified helper claimed by the PR. This is a meaningful nuance — the name survived but the architecture (centralization) did not.

## Cross-Team Reconciliation

### Where I Agree With Prior Teams

| Point | Team A | Team C | Judge | Me |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 28f6c3d caused claim-vs-HEAD drift | ✅ | ❌ (missed) | ✅ | ✅ |
| PR #7 is functionally complete | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PR #11 TOCTOU race condition risk | ⚠️ (noted) | ✅ (detailed) | ✅ | ✅ |
| PR #12 only 20% fix | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PR #14 EMFILE risk | ⚠️ (noted) | ✅ (detailed) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Runtime stability is green | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | ✅ |

### Where I Disagree / Correct

| PR | Prior Claim | My Correction | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#6** | "renderNode completely missing" (all teams) | Local `renderNode` functions exist at L585+L616 but are NOT unified | Grep confirms the name; architecture doesn't match claim |
| **#17** | "Complete" (Team A) | **Needs more work** — helpers file doesn't exist at HEAD | `find session-lifecycle*` returns only session-lifecycle.ts |
| **#13** | "Production Ready" (Judge) | **Test file doesn't exist at HEAD** | No `agent-behavior.test.ts` in tests/ directory |
| **#4,#5,#15,#16** | "Ready to merge" (Team C) | Meaningless — none exist at HEAD | Must be RE-APPLIED, not "merged" |
| **#6** | "Reject/restart" (Team C) | Nuanced — local functions are actually the BETTER pattern | Unified helper would add unnecessary abstraction for 2 consumers with different formatting needs |

## 5-Bucket Classification

### Bucket 1: ✅ Makes Into With Completion (2 PRs)

**PR #7 — SDK Context Singleton Tests**
- **Score**: 8.5/10
- **Rationale**: Test coverage functionally retained via `sdk-foundation.test.ts`. Singleton lifecycle, partial init, reset, withClient fallback all covered. All teams agree.
- **Remaining gap**: Double-init and concurrent access edge cases (P3, acceptable).

**PR #10 — Backup Failure Logging**
- **Score**: 7.5/10
- **Rationale**: `logger?.warn(...)` at persistence.ts:250 exists. The concept (observable failures > silent swallowing) is retained in save path.
- **Remaining gap**: `withState` rename failure path still silent (L289). Log level debate (warn vs error) is a P2 polish item. Close enough to "complete" that the gap is minor.

### Bucket 2: ⚠️ Makes But Needs More Work (4 PRs)

**PR #8 — Consolidate Config Constants**
- **Score**: 7/10
- **What's good**: The diff is architecturally sound — `as const` arrays derive types, validators reference arrays, CLI uses arrays for error messages. Single source of truth pattern.
- **What's missing at HEAD**: Everything reverted. Needs: re-export `GOVERNANCE_MODES` etc., update CLI messages to use arrays, restore `config-health.test.ts`.
- **Why it's not "out"**: The pattern is correct and eliminates a real maintenance burden (5 separate string lists duplicated across config + CLI + init).

**PR #5 — Extract Migration Logic**
- **Score**: 6.5/10
- **What's good**: Proper separation of concerns — migration in schema layer, not persistence layer.
- **What's missing at HEAD**: No `migrateBrainState` function exists. Migration logic still inline in persistence.ts.
- **Condition**: Only worth restoring if ALL load paths (persistence.ts + session-export.ts) use the extracted function. Single-consumer extraction has no value.

**PR #13 — Agent Behavior Prompt Tests**
- **Score**: 6/10
- **What's good**: Tests language injection, expert levels, output styles, constraint flags.
- **What's missing at HEAD**: Entire test file removed. Team C correctly identified missing boundary tests (null config, token=0, UTF-8 Vietnamese content).
- **Condition**: Restore with expanded coverage to justify a dedicated test file.

**PR #17 — Session Lifecycle Refactor**
- **Score**: 6/10
- **What's good**: The 700+ line extraction from session-lifecycle.ts is the right direction. The diff is well-structured.
- **What's missing at HEAD**: Entire helpers file doesn't exist. No import in session-lifecycle.ts.
- **Critical issues if restored as-is**: (1) Monolithic `-helpers.ts` naming violates "name by function" convention. (2) `handleStaleSession` does destructive archival with zero test coverage. (3) Combines 6+ unrelated concerns in one file.
- **Condition**: Must split into focused modules (context-compiler, stale-handler, warnings-compiler, hierarchy-compiler) and add tests for archival logic before restoring.

### Bucket 3: 🔄 On Point But Needs Different Direction (3 PRs)

**PR #11 — Async Lock Release**
- **Score**: 4/10
- **Intent**: Replace blocking `openSync`/`closeSync` with async `open`/`handle.close()` for event loop responsiveness.
- **Why direction change needed**: Team C's TOCTOU analysis is devastating. `openSync("wx")` provides atomic cross-process lock acquisition. Async `open("wx")` introduces a yield point where another process can steal the lock between check and use. The `release()` method also has a FileHandle leak if `close()` throws.
- **What would break**: Any concurrent tool executions that rely on `FileLock` for state consistency — core architectural invariant of the persistence layer.
- **Required direction**: Keep sync acquisition (`openSync` is intentional, not a bug). If event loop responsiveness is needed, consider: (a) worker thread for lock operations, (b) advisory locking with `flock`, or (c) accepting the ~1ms sync cost as negligible for this use case.

**PR #12 — Path Traversal Fix**
- **Score**: 4/10
- **Intent**: Sanitize `stamp` parameter with `basename()` to prevent path traversal.
- **Why direction change needed**: Fixes 1 of 5+ vulnerable locations. The PRIMARY attack vector (`manifest.json` → `entry.file` → arbitrary path) remains wide open. A one-off `basename()` creates a false sense of security.
- **What would break**: If only partial fix is applied, security audit would flag the codebase as "addressed" when 80% of the attack surface remains.
- **Required direction**: Implement defense-in-depth `safeJoin()` utility with `path.resolve` validation. Apply to ALL manifest parsing and session resolution paths. This is the HIGHEST PRIORITY item across all 14 PRs.

**PR #14 — Concurrent Backup Cleanup**
- **Score**: 3.5/10
- **Intent**: Replace sequential `for` loop with `Promise.all` for concurrent deletion.
- **Why direction change needed**: Unbounded `Promise.all` risks EMFILE (file descriptor exhaustion). But more fundamentally — the actual use case deletes 3-10 old backups. Sequential deletion of 10 files takes <5ms. The optimization targets a non-existent bottleneck.
- **What would break**: EMFILE under edge cases with backup accumulation (e.g., if cleanup was previously broken).
- **Required direction**: If pursued, use bounded concurrency (batch of 10). But honestly, the sequential loop is the right answer for this scale. Consider closing this PR.

### Bucket 4: ❌ Totally Out of the List (2 PRs)

**PR #9 — CliFormatter Standardization**
- **Score**: 2/10
- **Why out**: Artifact completely removed at HEAD. No `CliFormatter` class exists. The plugin's CLI surface is small (2 formatting tools: `recall-mems`, `list-shelves`). Creating a dedicated formatter utility for 2 consumers is over-engineering. The duplication is ~45 lines — tolerable for this scale.
- **If reconsidered**: The formatting duplication could be addressed with a simple shared function, not a full class with headers/sections/footers/key-value methods. The class-based approach is inappropriate for this codebase size.

**PR #16 — Extract Levenshtein Utility**
- **Score**: 2.5/10
- **Why out**: `levenshteinSimilarity` is used in exactly ONE place (detection.ts:474). Extracting a single-consumer function to `src/utils/string.ts` is premature abstraction. The function is also misnamed — it's actually a character-overlap Jaccard similarity, not Levenshtein distance. Creating a utils/ directory for one function sets a precedent that will attract more premature extractions.
- **If reconsidered**: Only extract when a second consumer appears. And rename the function to `charOverlapSimilarity` to accurately describe what it computes.

### Bucket 5: 📭 Sounds Good But Currently No Way to Improve (3 PRs)

**PR #4 — Flatten Tree Optimization**
- **Score**: 5/10 (good code, low leverage)
- **Why no leverage**: The diff is technically sound (iterative DFS, eliminates O(N²) intermediate allocations). But hierarchy trees in this plugin are typically <50 nodes. The benchmark (64ms→32ms for 781 nodes over 1000 iterations) tests a scale this plugin will never reach. Stack overflow risk at <50 nodes is zero. The recursive version is more readable.
- **When it would matter**: Only if the plugin were used in projects with deep/wide hierarchy trees (hundreds of nodes). Current governance model keeps trees pruned.

**PR #6 — Hierarchy Rendering Refactor**
- **Score**: 4/10 (my unique finding changes the verdict)
- **Why no leverage**: The local `renderNode` functions in `toAsciiTree` (L585) and `toActiveMdBody` (L616) have fundamentally DIFFERENT formatting logic — one produces ASCII tree with connectors (`|--`, `\--`), the other produces Markdown with checkboxes (`[x]`, `[ ]`). Forcing these into a unified helper would require format flags/modes, adding complexity without reducing LOC. The current "duplicated" local functions are actually the RIGHT pattern.
- **When it would matter**: Only if a third rendering format were added, at which point extraction to a strategy/visitor pattern would be justified.

**PR #15 — fs.copyFile Brain Backup Optimization**
- **Score**: 5/10 (real optimization, wrong bottleneck)
- **Why no leverage**: The 75% speedup (1990ms→505ms) was benchmarked on a 50MB file. Real `brain.json` files are <1MB. At 1MB, the difference is negligible (~4ms vs ~1ms). The actual save pipeline bottleneck is the atomic `rename()` + `cleanupOldBackups()`, not the copy operation.
- **When it would matter**: Only if brain.json grows to multi-MB sizes, which would indicate a different problem (state bloat) that should be solved by compaction, not faster copying.
