# Tools Sector Guidance

**Evidence level:** L5 documentation guidance only. This file does not prove runtime readiness; runtime claims require L1-L3 proof from authorized verification workflows.

## 1. Sector purpose and lifecycle role

`src/tools/` is the Hard Harness write-side sector. Tool implementations expose validated OpenCode tool commands for delegation, status polling, background commands, prompt enhancement, primitive configuration, trajectory, pressure, SDK supervision, command engine, and agent work contracts. Source evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:87-113`, `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:104-108`.

## 2. Allowed mutation authority

- Tools are the CQRS mutation authority for runtime operations and may write through approved library state owners. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:72-80`, `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:339-353`.
- Tools may parse input via Zod schemas and render standardized responses with `src/shared/`. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:87-113`, `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:295-300`.
- Tools may call OpenCode SDK wrappers, delegation managers, state owners, config workflow, and schema validators when the tool contract explicitly requires it. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:273-285`.

## 3. Forbidden mutations / explicit no-go boundaries

- Tools SHALL NOT bypass schema validation for external or agent-provided input.
- Tools SHALL NOT write internal runtime state into `.opencode/`; state writes go through `.hivemind/` owners. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:247-255`, `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:351-353`.
- Tools SHALL NOT register themselves directly in arbitrary files; `src/plugin.ts` owns registration. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:221-224`.
- Tools SHALL NOT claim completion, integration, or runtime readiness from mocked/unit-only proof when the claim is about OpenCode integration.

## 4. Actors and consumers

| Actor / consumer | Uses this sector for | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Agents and commands | Invoke tool contracts during workflows | Must pass schema-valid inputs |
| `src/plugin.ts` | Registers tool definitions with OpenCode | Does not embed tool business logic |
| `src/task-management/`, `src/coordination/`, `src/features/` owners | Perform durable state, lifecycle, SDK, and orchestration logic | Tools call them; tools do not duplicate deep logic |
| `src/shared/` | Provides response envelope rendering | Shared stays leaf |
| Tests/gates | Verify validation, outputs, and side effects | Integration claims require integration evidence |

## 5. Naming and placement conventions

- Single-file tools live at `src/tools/{tool-name}.ts`; multi-file tools live at `src/tools/{tool-name}/index.ts`. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:221-224`.
- Add or update schemas in `src/schema-kernel/{tool-name}.schema.ts` when validation is needed. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:221-224`, `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:237-240`.
- Tool tests live under `tests/tools/{tool-name}.test.ts` and mirror the source contract. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:221-224`, `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md:52-64`.
- Tool output must use the shared envelope rather than bespoke response shapes. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:334-337`.

## 6. Quality gates and evidence expectations

- Code changes require `npm run typecheck` and scoped tool tests; run broader `npm test` when touching shared contracts or state owners. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md:41-48`.
- Mutation claims require evidence of the intended state surface and proof that `.opencode/` was not used for internal state.
- Docs-only edits to this file are L5 evidence and must not be used to claim runtime readiness. Evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:47-49`.
