# Schema Kernel Sector Guidance

**Evidence level:** L5 documentation guidance only. This file does not prove runtime readiness; runtime claims require L1-L3 proof from authorized verification workflows.

## 1. Sector purpose and lifecycle role

`src/schema-kernel/` is the Hard Harness validation-contract sector. It owns Zod v4 schemas for OpenCode meta-concepts, permissions, MCP servers, prompt enhancement, config precedence, agent work contracts, runtime pressure, SDK supervision, command engine, doc intelligence, and trajectory surfaces. Source evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:195-200`, `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:114-118`.

## 2. Allowed mutation authority

- Schema files may define and export validation contracts, typed parse results, fallback validation helpers, and barrel exports.
- Schema changes may support tools, config workflow, validation/restart checks, and primitive configuration when paired with consumers. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:195-200`, `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:42-56`.
- Schema changes may reject, strip, or warn on invalid structures according to the owning tool or config workflow contract. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:397-401`.

## 3. Forbidden mutations / explicit no-go boundaries

- Schemas SHALL NOT perform durable writes, SDK calls, filesystem state mutation, or command execution.
- Schemas SHALL NOT become hidden runtime feature implementations; they define contracts consumed by tools/lib modules.
- Schemas SHALL NOT introduce `any` on new code or bypass TypeScript strictness. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md:70-75`.
- Schemas SHALL NOT claim registry/config completeness when consumers are partial or missing. Evidence: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:42-56`.

## 4. Actors and consumers

| Actor / consumer | Uses this sector for | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `src/tools/configure-primitive.ts` and `validate-restart` | Validate primitive and restart contracts | Must handle schema errors through tool responses |
| Config workflow and runtime policy modules | Parse and validate workspace/config contracts | Must own side effects outside the schema |
| Tests | Validate accepted/rejected shapes | Schema tests do not prove runtime integration |
| `.opencode/` primitives | Are validated by schemas where supported | Schema existence is not registry enforcement by itself |

## 5. Naming and placement conventions

- Schema files use `kebab-case.schema.ts`; barrel exports live in `src/schema-kernel/index.ts`. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:186-195`, `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:237-240`.
- Tests live under `tests/schema-kernel/` and validate real Zod behavior. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md:52-64`, `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md:208-213`.
- Use named exports and ESM `.js` import conventions where imports are needed. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md:80-98`, `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md:169-181`.

## 6. Quality gates and evidence expectations

- Schema changes require `npm run typecheck` and scoped `npx vitest run tests/schema-kernel/...` evidence.
- If a schema change claims runtime enforcement, provide consumer evidence from the owning tool/lib module; schema-only proof is insufficient.
- Docs-only edits remain L5 evidence and must not alter readiness status. Evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:47-49`.
