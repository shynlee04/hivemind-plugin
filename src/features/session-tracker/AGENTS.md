# Session Tracker Feature Guidance

**Parent sector:** `src/features/AGENTS.md` | **Architecture:** `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` | **Classification:** Hard Harness — runtime-feature (read-side: session knowledge capture)

**Evidence level:** L5 documentation guidance only. This file does not prove runtime readiness; runtime claims require L1-L3 proof from authorized verification workflows.

## 1. Sector purpose and lifecycle role

`src/features/session-tracker/` owns session knowledge capture under `.hivemind/session-tracker/`. It replaces the broken event tracker (`src/task-management/journal/event-tracker/`) with a clean, structured, hook-driven capture system. Source evidence: `.planning/phases/CP-ST-01-session-tracker-revamp/01-SPEC.md`.

## 2. Allowed mutation authority

- SessionTracker may write session knowledge files to `.hivemind/session-tracker/` exclusively.
- SessionTracker may read `.hivemind/session-tracker/` files for recovery purposes.
- All writes use atomic rename pattern (D-03): write-to-tmp → `fs.rename()`.

## 3. Forbidden mutations / explicit no-go boundaries

- SessionTracker SHALL NOT write to deprecated paths. `.hivemind/event-tracker/` was removed in CP-ST-03.
- SessionTracker SHALL NOT store runtime state in `.opencode/`. Source evidence: `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md:247-255`.
- SessionTracker SHALL NOT exceed the 500 LOC module cap. Source evidence: `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md:19-28`.
- SessionTracker SHALL NOT write files directly from hook callbacks (CQRS compliance per REQ-ST-11).

## 4. Actors and consumers

| Actor / consumer | Uses this sector for | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `src/hooks/` | Routes OpenCode lifecycle events to SessionTracker methods | Hooks observe; module owns persistence |
| `src/plugin.ts` | Instantiates SessionTracker, passes to hooks via deps injection | One instantiation line only |
| Agents (recovery) | Rebuild context from persisted .md/.json files after disconnection | Read-only consumption |
| Tests | Validate type safety, persistence correctness, and boundary compliance | Unit tests in `tests/features/session-tracker/` |

## 5. Naming and placement conventions

- Modules use `kebab-case.ts` in `src/features/session-tracker/`.
- Barrel export at `index.ts`.
- Types in `types.ts`.
- Persistence layer in `persistence/` subdirectory.
- Tests mirror under `tests/features/session-tracker/`.
- All field names use camelCase per REQ-ST-12.
- All writes target `.hivemind/session-tracker/` root — never elsewhere.

## 6. Quality gates and evidence expectations

- Code changes require `npm run typecheck` and scoped `npx vitest run tests/features/session-tracker/`.
- Write safety requires atomic rename verification (interrupt-then-restart test).
- Path safety requires traversal rejection validation.
- Docs-only edits remain L5 evidence. Source evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:47-49`.

## 7. Architecture compliance

- CQRS boundary: Hooks MUST NOT directly write to `.hivemind/`. Hook effects route through this module.
- 9-surface authority: `src/features/session-tracker/` owns typed capture logic; `.hivemind/session-tracker/` owns persisted state.
- Deps injection: SessionTracker receives `{ client, projectRoot }` via constructor (matches DelegationManager pattern).
