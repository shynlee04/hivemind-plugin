## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-update` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
Check for GSD updates, install if available, and display what changed.

Routes to the update workflow which handles:
- Version detection (local vs global installation)
- npm version checking
- Changelog fetching and display
- User confirmation with clean install warning
- Update execution and cache clearing
- Restart reminder
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/Users/apple/hivemind-plugin/.worktrees/harness-experiment/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/update.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the update workflow** from `@/Users/apple/hivemind-plugin/.worktrees/harness-experiment/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/update.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Installed version detection (local/global)
2. Latest version checking via npm
3. Version comparison
4. Changelog fetching and extraction
5. Clean install warning display
6. User confirmation
7. Update execution
8. Cache clearing
</process>
