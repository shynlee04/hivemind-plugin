<augment_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-quick` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking).

Quick mode is the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode) + gsd-executor(s)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table (NOT ROADMAP.md)

**Default:** Skips research, discussion, plan-checker, verifier. Use when you know exactly what to do.

**`--discuss` flag:** Lightweight discussion phase before planning. Surfaces assumptions, clarifies gray areas, captures decisions in CONTEXT.md. Use when the task has ambiguity worth resolving upfront.

**`--full` flag:** Enables the complete quality pipeline — discussion + research + plan-checking + verification. One flag for everything.

**`--validate` flag:** Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification only. Use when you want quality guarantees without discussion or research.

**`--research` flag:** Spawns a focused research agent before planning. Investigates implementation approaches, library options, and pitfalls for the task. Use when you're unsure of the best approach.

Granular flags are composable: `--discuss --research --validate` gives the same result as `--full`.

<execution_context>
@/Users/apple/hivemind-plugin/.worktrees/harness-experiment/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md
</execution_context>

<context>
{{GSD_ARGS}}

Context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init quick`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
Execute the quick workflow from @/Users/apple/hivemind-plugin/.worktrees/harness-experiment/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, task description, planning, execution, state updates, commits).
