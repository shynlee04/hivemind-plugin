## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-next` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
Detect the current project state and automatically invoke the next logical GSD workflow step.
No arguments needed — reads STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, and phase directories to determine what comes next.

Designed for rapid multi-project workflows where remembering which phase/step you're on is overhead.

Supports `--force` flag to bypass safety gates (checkpoint, error state, verification failures).

<process>
Execute the next workflow from @/Users/apple/hivemind-plugin/.worktrees/harness-experiment/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/next.md end-to-end.
