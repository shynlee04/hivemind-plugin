- [architecture-evaluation-codewiki-2026-02-18] Codewiki Architecture Decision: REJECT Gemini's LLM-based approach. USE tree-sitter compression (like Repomix). Leverage existing: event-bus.ts, watcher.ts, cognitive-packer.ts. ADD: tiktoken, tree-sitter, secret-detection. 3-Phase: Foundation → Incremental Pipeline → Context Integration.
- [code-intelligence-engine-architecture-2026-02-19] Architecture Decision: Native Code Intelligence Engine - REJECT LLM-based codewiki, USE tree-sitter WASM compression (~70% token reduction). 3 phases: Foundation (gitignore, token count, secrets), Incremental (watch-based updates), Integration (cognitive-packer). Duration: 9-12 days. Doc: docs/plans/2026-02-19-code-intelligence-engine-architecture.md
