# HiveMind Historical Plans

Archived HiveMind plans that are no longer active but may be useful for reference.

## Files in This Archive

1. `HiveMind_Context_Governance_Worktree_dff10786.md` - Original implementation plan for v1.0.0
   - Described the full 8-phase implementation
   - Phase 1-4 marked DONE (bootstrap, schemas, tools, hooks)
   - Phase 5 (OpenTUI Dashboard): PENDING
   - Phase 6 (CLI): DONE
   - Phase 7 (Tests): Showed 76 assertions
   - Phase 8 (Docs): AGENTS.md done, README.md pending

## Why This Plan Was Archived

- Plan was created for a worktree at `.worktrees/hivemind-context-governance/` (no longer used)
- Test counts changed from 76 to 131 (self_rate tool added in v1.2.0)
- Plan says "3 tools" but current code has 4 tools
- Success criteria: 5/11 checked. Dashboard and TypeScript compilation unchecked.
- The plan is partially stale and superseded by ongoing development.

## Current Active Planning

- `.hivemind/plans/` - Active development plans
- `docs/plans/` - Published plans
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent-facing documentation
