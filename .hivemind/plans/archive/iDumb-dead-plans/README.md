# iDumb v2 Legacy Plans

These plans are from the predecessor project "iDumb v2" and are **no longer applicable** to the current HiveMind codebase.

They are preserved here for historical reference only.

## Files in This Archive

**Note:** The spec listed 7 iDumb plans to archive, but only 1 file actually existed in `.plan/plans/` at archive time. The other 6 files listed below were not found and could not be moved.

**Archived Files (1 total):**
1. `Brain_Engine_Prototype_980105f5.md` - Described a `govern_brain` tool with 5 actions. Files and paths do not exist in HiveMind.

**Files Not Found (6 total):**
- `iDumb_Strategic_Reset_Framework_f8434a4c.md` - Strategic reset plan for iDumb. Not applicable.
- `iDumb_Plugin_Reboot_v2_96f02b43.md` - iDumb v2 plugin reboot plan. Not applicable.
- `iDumb_Plugin_Reboot_d5317467.md` - iDumb v1 plugin reboot plan. Not applicable.
- `MICRO-MILESTONE-ARCHITECTURE-2026-02-05.md` - iDumb micro-milestone architecture. Not applicable.
- `concerns-of-approach.md` - 5-line concern note. Not applicable.
- (7th file name not recorded in spec)

## Why These Are Dead

- HiveMind simplified from iDumb's complex agent hierarchy (Coordinator/Investigator/Executor)
- HiveMind has 4 tools instead of iDumb's many `govern_*` tools
- File paths (`.idumb/brain/index/`, `src/tools/govern-brain.ts`) don't exist in HiveMind
- Worktree paths (`/Users/apple/Documents/coding-projects/idumb/v2-brain-prototype`) are not this repo

## Status

**DO NOT USE THESE PLANS.** They reference non-existent code and paths.

Current active planning: `.hivemind/plans/` and `docs/plans/`
