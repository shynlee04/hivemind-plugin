## Decision Matrix: Action Verb → Lineage

| Action Verb | Lineage | Domain Bundle |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| create, add, build (agent) | hf-* | Agent Building |
| create, write, audit (skill) | hf-* | Skill Authoring |
| create, add (command) | hf-* | Command Dev |
| build, create (tool/plugin) | hf-* | Tool Building |
| audit, drift, refactor (meta) | hf-* | Audit/Refactor |
| synthesize, extract (patterns) | hf-* | Synthesis |
| research, investigate, find | hm-* | Research |
| plan, spec, design, architect | hm-* | Planning |
| implement, build, execute, run | hm-* | Execution |
| test, verify, validate, TDD | hm-* | Quality |
| debug, fix, broken | hm-* | Debug |
| review, audit (code), readiness | hm-* | Review |
| configure, set up | hf-* or hm-* | Check subject matter |

## Cross-Lineage Rules

```
hm-* agents (STRICT):
  └── May load: hm-* skills (always), gate-* skills (for quality), stack-* skills (for reference)
  └── May NOT load: hf-* skills (unless explicitly routed by hf-l0-orchestrator with justification)

hf-* agents (FLEXIBLE):
  └── May load: hf-* skills (always), gate-* skills (for quality), stack-* skills (for reference)
  └── May load: hm-* skills for codebase investigation (hm-detective, hm-deep-research, hm-synthesis)
                 Must document justification in return report.

gate-* skills (INTERNAL):
  └── May load: stack-* skills (for reference)
  └── May load: hm-* skills for inspection
  └── May NOT load: hf-* skills (gate skills don't create meta-concepts)

stack-* skills (REFERENCE):
  └── May load: other stack-* skills (cross-reference)
  └── May NOT load: hm-* or hf-* skills (stack is read-only reference)
```

## Command Prefix Routing

| Prefix | Lineage | Load |
|--------|---------|------|
| `/hf-create` | hf-* | `hf-l2-skill-router` |
| `/hf-audit` | hf-* | `hf-l2-skill-router` |
| `/hf-stack` | hf-* | `hf-l2-skill-router` |
| `/hf-configure` | hf-* | `hf-l2-skill-router` |
| `/plan` | hm-* | `hm-l2-lineage-router` |
| `/ultrawork` | hm-* | `hm-l2-lineage-router` |
| `/gsd-*` | hm-* (via GSD) | `hm-l2-lineage-router` |
| No prefix | Classify by intent | See decision tree above |

## Examples

### Example 1: "Create a skill for deep research that uses repomix"
- Action: "create" (meta-concept creation)
- Subject: "skill" (meta-concept)
- Verdict: **hf-* lineage → Skill Authoring domain**
- Load: `hf-l2-skill-router` → bundle: `hf-l2-use-authoring-skills` + `hf-l2-skill-synthesis`

### Example 2: "Debug the session-tracker module — tests are failing"
- Action: "debug" (product dev)
- Subject: "session-tracker module" (source code)
- Verdict: **hm-* lineage → Debug domain**
- Load: `hm-l2-lineage-router` → bundle: `hm-l2-debug` + `hm-l2-completion-looping`

### Example 3: "Audit all skills in the project for trigger phrase compliance"
- Action: "audit" (quality inspection)
- Subject: "skills" (meta-concepts)
- Verdict: **hf-* lineage → Audit domain**
- Load: `hf-l2-skill-router` → bundle: `hf-l2-use-authoring-skills` + `hf-l2-agents-md-sync` + `gate-l3-evidence-truth`

### Example 4: "/hf-audit"
- Command prefix: `/hf-audit`
- Verdict: **hf-* lineage (command-driven)**
- Load: `hf-l2-skill-router` immediately

### Example 5: "I'm not sure what workflow to use — I have a new feature idea"
- Action: ambiguous
- Subject: "feature idea" (product dev)
- Verdict: **hm-* lineage → Brainstorm/Panning domain**
- Load: `hm-l2-lineage-router` → `hm-l2-brainstorm` first
- If still unclear: use session-tracker to read last user turn

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: Meta-concept + Product-dev hybrid request
Example: "Build an agent that debugs the session-tracker module"

- Primary: "Build an agent" → hf-* (Agent Building)
- Secondary: "debugs session-tracker" → hm-* (Debug)
- Verdict: **hf-* primary** (agent creation is the meta-concept action)
- Load: hf-bundle first, then document hm-* cross-lineage access

### Case 2: User provides a command prefix but topic is ambiguous
Example: "/plan create a new skill"

- `/plan` → hm-* lineage
- But "create a skill" is meta-concept → hf-* lineage
- Verdict: **Command prefix takes precedence** → hm-* lineage
- Result: hm-orchestrator will route to hm-planner, which will detect the meta-concept topic and escalate to hf lineage if needed via cross-lineage bridge

### Case 3: User addresses an L2 agent directly
Example: "@hm-l2-auditor audit the session-tracker"

- Direct L2 mention: user is explicitly routing to hm-*
- Verdict: **hm-* lineage** (user-directed)
- Note: L0 should still intercept and delegate properly through L1
