# Hivemind Power-On — Session Governance Core

## LOAD THIS FIRST. LOAD IT EVERY TURN.

This skill is how the entire Hivemind agent system stays alive across disconnects, aborts, compacts, and multi-day sessions. Every agent at L0/L1 loads this before anything else. **If you loaded it at session start, load it again at every user turn** — especially sessions that last many turns. The context changes. The session state evolves. You need the current picture.

**You are NOT loading this for the rules. You are loading this to see what is alive RIGHT NOW.**

---

## 1. THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS: SESSION-TRACKER KNOWS EVERYTHING

The session-tracker at `.hivemind/session-tracker/` saves **every** session that ever ran on this project. Aborted. Completed. Cancelled. Active. It doesn't matter. Every single one has:

- A `.md` file with the full conversation
- A `session-continuity.json` with the delegation hierarchy
- A `project-continuity.json` index of all sessions

```json
// .hivemind/session-tracker/project-continuity.json
{
  "sessions": {
    "ses_1e665f792ffel0aC0a0qM0Oxo1": {
      "status": "active",       // aborted mid-work
      "childCount": 0,
      "totalDelegationDepth": 0
    }
  },
  "chronologicalOrder": ["ses_...", "ses_..."]
}
```

**This means:** There are NO lost sessions. Everything is recoverable. The only thing you need is the session ID. And the session-tracker gives you that.

### What you do at every power-on (start, resume, every user turn):

```
1. session-tracker({action:"list-sessions"})         // → get ALL session IDs
2. Read project-continuity.json                       // → see statuses, depths, children
3. Filter: "active" sessions that might need resume    // → aborted = active, completed = completed
4. For each aborted/active session → note the ID
5. Continue your routing with those IDs in your pocket
```

**That's it.** Three tool calls. You now know everything alive in this project.

---

## 2. THE DELEGATION PATTERN: "NO THOUGHT MUST" — BY ALL COSTS CONTINUE

This is the most important thing this skill teaches you. **Memorize it.**

```
WHEN you see a session ID from session-tracker (ANY status):
  → task({subagent_type: <same>, task_id: <exact ID>, prompt: "Continue"})
  → NO reasoning about whether it's the right session
  → NO checking if context was preserved (it IS — automatically)
  → NO asking "but what if it completed?" (it returns safely if wrong)
  → JUST DELEGATE
```

### Why this works without thinking:

| What you worry about | What actually happens |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Is this the right session?" | Even if wrong, the subagent gets context from the wrong session → returns safely. No harm. |
| "Was context preserved after abort?" | YES. OpenCode saves conversation state on every turn. Abort = last saved state is restored. |
| "Should I repeat the prompt?" | NO. Context is auto-restored. Repeating prompt wastes context. Just say "Continue." |
| "The front agent doesn't know what the downstream was doing" | **That's fine.** The downstream agent knows. Its context was preserved. You don't need to know. |
| "The session completed, should I start new?" | Resume the completed session with the SAME ID. It continues the chain. If it's truly done, the subagent tells you. |

### Real example from this project:

```
Session-tracker shows: ses_1e665f792ffel0aC0a0qM0Oxo1 (status: "active", gsd-planner)

The correct response:
  → task({description:"resume", subagent_type:"gsd-planner", task_id:"ses_1e665f792ffel0aC0a0qM0Oxo1"})
  → The planner resumes with its FULL context (844 lines of prompt, all tool calls)
  → It continues from where it was interrupted
  → NO need to re-send requirements, research, or context
```

**The WRONG response (what most agents do):**
```
  → Read the .md file (waste)
  → Re-read all the context files (waste)
  → Reason about whether it's the right session (waste)
  → Start a NEW task with a different ID (WRONG — loses the chain)
  → Re-send the full prompt (waste)
```

## 3. LOAD THIS AT EVERY USER TURN

This is **not** a "load once at start" skill. You must load it:

| When | Why |
|------|-----|
| Session start | Get the current session landscape |
| **Every user turn** | Session state may have changed. New aborts. New children. |
| After disconnect | Find sessions that need resume |
| After compact | Reconstruct state from disk |
| Before delegation | Check if there's a session to resume vs create new |
| After delegation returns | Check if the subagent left something to continue |

**Multi-turn sessions:** The session-tracker is being written to by YOUR OWN previous turns. If you don't reload this skill, you won't see the sessions YOU created.

---

## 4. ROUTING: WHICH LINEAGE, WHICH LEVEL

Decision tree for where work goes. Read TOP to BOTTOM.

```
USER SENDS REQUEST
│
├──→ Is this about meta-concepts? (agents, skills, commands, tools)
│   └──→ hf-lineage
│       ├── Single concept, known type → FAST PATH → hf-l2-* directly
│       └── Multi-concept, investigation, remediation → hf-l1-coordinator
│
├──→ Is this about features, bugs, architecture, implementation?
│   └──→ hm-lineage
│       ├── Simple, well-defined → hm-l1-coordinator (direct L2 dispatch)
│       └── Complex, research needed → hm-l1-coordinator (waves)
│
├──→ Is this an ambiguous command?
│   └──→ hm-l2-intent-loop for clarification
│
├──→ Is this a disconnected/resume scenario?
│   └──→ BY ALL COSTS CONTINUE → task tool with EXACT session ID
│       ├── Aborted? → same ID, context preserved
│       ├── Completed? → same ID, context preserved
│       └── Cancelled? → same ID or new (check with user)
│
└──→ Is this a cross-lineage request?
    └──→ hf needs codebase investigation? → hm-l1-coordinator (cross-lineage)
        hm needs meta-concept? → hf-l1-coordinator (cross-lineage)
```

### Depth rules (non-negotiable):

```
L0 → L1 → L2  (one level per delegation)
L0 → L2       (ONLY for fast-path single-concept hf-* tasks)
L2 → L2       (NEVER — L2 cannot delegate)
L0 → L2 skip  (NEVER — always through coordinator for multi-concept)
Depth > 3     (NEVER — escalate to user)
```

---

## 5. FINDING AND RESUMING SESSIONS — THE ACTUAL WORKFLOW

### When you think "I should continue a session":

```
STEP 1: session-tracker({action:"list-sessions"})
        → Gets all session IDs + statuses
STEP 2: session-tracker({action:"search-sessions", query:"aborted"})
        → Finds sessions that were interupted
STEP 3: For each aborted/active session:
        session-hierarchy({action:"get-delegation-depth", sessionId:"ses_xxx"})
        → Check depth, find deepest active child
STEP 4: task({subagent_type:"<matching type>", task_id:"<deepest active ID>"})
        → Continue. Context preserved. No thinking.
```

### When you're mid-session and need to re-delegate to a completed sub:

```
The subagent returned. You got its results. But you need it to do MORE.

  → task({task_id:"<SAME subagent session ID>", prompt:"Now do this additional thing..."})
  → The same subagent continues with its previous context PLUS your new instruction
  → No need to re-establish anything — it remembers everything
```

### When you're sure it's the wrong session:

```
task returns garbage or subagent says "I don't recognize this"
  → It returns safely (user's words: "even it is wrong it will returns safely")
  → Start fresh with a new task. No harm done.
```

---

## 6. QUALITY GATES: WHAT TO RUN BEFORE CLAIMING DONE

Every delegation that returns must pass the triad. In order. No skipping.

```
1. gate-lifecycle-integration   → Does it participate in the runtime correctly?
2. gate-spec-compliance         → Does it meet the spec requirements?
3. gate-evidence-truth          → Is there actual proof? (not just claims)
```

**Sequence:** Load `gate-l3-lifecycle-integration` → run it → returns PASS or FAIL.
→ If PASS: Load `gate-l3-spec-compliance` → run it → returns PASS or FAIL.
→ If PASS: Load `gate-l3-evidence-truth` → run it → returns PASS or FAIL.
→ If ALL PASS: Done.
→ If ANY FAIL: Return to the delegation target with the specific remediation.

Max 3 retry cycles. After 3, escalate to user with the full gap report.

## 7. WHAT EACH LAYER ACTUALLY DOES WITH THIS

| Layer | What they NEED from this skill |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **L0 Orchestrator** | Full routing: find aborted sessions, resume them, know all active work |
| **L1 Coordinator** | Delegation management: track children, know which to resume, gate their returns |
| **L2 Specialist** | NOTHING from this skill. But they MUST know: "I was loaded by an L1 who loaded this. If I get interrupted, my session WILL be saved and can be resumed." |

---

## 8. REFERENCE FILES (read on demand, not all at once)

| File | What it has | Read when |
|------|------------|-----------|
| `references/01-session-tracker-anatomy.md` | Full session-tracker structure and schemas | You need to navigate `.hivemind/session-tracker/` manually |
| `references/02-task-tool-resume.md` | Task tool resume mechanics and worked examples | You're resuming an aborted session |
| `references/03-lineage-routing-tree.md` | Complete hm vs hf decision tree with command maps | You're unsure which lineage to route to |
| `references/04-project-phase-routing.md` | Phase-to-specialist mapping tables | You're dispatching a phase and need the right L2 |
| `references/05-continuity-navigation.md` | project-continuity.json navigation patterns | You're recovering from disconnect and need to find your place |
| `references/06-delegation-depth-recovery.md` | Multi-level recovery cascade protocol | You're recovering from a deep delegation (L1→L2→...) |

---

## 9. TOOL CATALOG REFERENCE

See [Section 10](#10-custom-tool-catalog--available-harness-tools) for the full list of 22 custom tools available via the Hivemind plugin. Every L0/L1 agent should read this section to understand what tools are at their disposal.

---

## 11. THE SHORT VERSION (for when context is tight)

```
1. session-tracker({action:"list-sessions"}) → see what exists
2. Any aborted/active session → task with its ID → context preserved
3. "No thought must" — even if wrong, it returns safely
4. Every user turn → reload this skill
5. Every delegation return → quality gate triad
6. Depth max = 3 → escalate to user
```

---

## 10. CUSTOM TOOL CATALOG — AVAILABLE HARNESS TOOLS

The Hivemind plugin registers these custom tools at startup. All are callable directly from agent workflows. Each tool has a `delegate_task` or native-Task analog; prefer the custom tool when you need harness-tracked delegation.

| Tool Name | What It Does | When To Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `delegate-task` | Create a child session via SDK dispatch, tracked by DelegationManager | You need harness-tracked delegation with dual-signal completion, recovery, and notification routing |
| `delegation-status` | Poll delegation state: status, progress, abort, cancel, restart, resume, chain, adjust-prompt, change-agent | You need to check on or control a running delegation |
| `run-background-command` | Execute a shell command in a background/PTY session | You need a long-running shell command that shouldn't block the agent |
| `prompt-skim` | Fast skim of a prompt for structure and intent | You need a quick overview before deep analysis |
| `prompt-analyze` | Deep analysis of a prompt for contradictions, gaps, risks | You need to audit a prompt before sending it |
| `session-patch` | Modify session properties or metadata | You need to update session state |
| `execute-slash-command` | Run a registered OpenCode slash command | You need to invoke a command programmatically |
| `session-journal-export` | Export session journal to file | You need to persist session history for audit |
| `hivemind-doc` | Query Hivemind documentation | You need docs about harness features |
| `hivemind-trajectory` | Query execution trajectory / decision lineage | You need to trace what decisions led to current state |
| `hivemind-pressure` | Query runtime pressure / budget status | You need to check circuit-breaker or tool budget status |
| `hivemind-sdk-supervisor` | Inspect SDK client state and connection health | You need to debug SDK integration issues |
| `hivemind-command-engine` | Execute the Hivemind command engine | You need to run engine-level commands |
| `session-tracker` | List, search, and inspect session records | You need to find or resume a session |
| `session-hierarchy` | Get delegation depth and parent/child tree | You need to understand session lineage |
| `session-context` | Get session context from continuity | You need to recover context for a session |
| `hivemind-agent-work-create` | Create an agent work contract | You need to define a formal work agreement |
| `hivemind-agent-work-export` | Export agent work contract to file | You need to persist a work agreement |
| `configure-primitive` | Configure OpenCode primitives (agents, commands, skills) | You need to update config via tool |
| `validate-restart` | Validate restart safety before reconnecting | You need to check it's safe to restart |
| `bootstrap-init` | Initialize harness bootstrap state | First-time setup of a Hivemind project |
| `bootstrap-recover` | Recover from bootstrap failure | You need to recover a broken bootstrap |

**Important**: The `delegate-task` tool routes through `DelegationCoordinator.dispatch()` → `client.session.create()` + `client.session.promptAsync()` (SDK surface available at plugin runtime). It is NOT blocked — the `UNSUPPORTED_NATIVE_TASK_MESSAGE` was removed in a refactor that replaced the old `ToolContext.task` approach with the SDK client path.

## 11. ESCALATION — WHEN TO TELL THE USER

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| 3 consecutive gate failures on same delegation | Escalate with full gap report, evidence, and retry history |
| delegation depth reaches 3 | Escalate: "This chain is too deep. Need architectural split." |
| session-tracker not responding | Fallback: `glob(".hivemind/session-tracker/*/")` → find directories directly |
| Ambiguous hm vs hf lineage | Load `hm-l2-user-intent-interactive-loop` → clarify with user |
| task_id not found (session doesn't exist) | Export the `.md` session content, extract the prompt, create NEW dispatch with same params |
