# Research Chain

## 6-NON Defence Table

| NON | Defence |
|-----|---------|
| NON-1 | Pre-authoring audit: chain stages mapped in `references/chain-audit.md` |
| NON-2 | Stacks with `hm-detective` + `hm-deep-research` + `hm-synthesis`; clashes with single-skill research |
| NON-3 | Entry: research intent clarified → Exit: artifact exported → Loop-back: synthesis insufficient |
| NON-4 | `metadata.layer: 1` — picked by primary coordinators and pure-orchestrators |
| NON-5 | Stacked eval with full chain: detective → deep-research → synthesis |
| NON-6 | P1-router pattern: body ~150 LOC, 2 references, 1 script |

## The Iron Law

```
Research without synthesis is hoarding. Synthesis without evidence is hallucination.
```

## The Canonical Chain

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  DETECT     │ ──→ │   RESEARCH   │ ──→ │ SYNTHESIZE│ ──→ │ ARTIFACT │
│(hm-detective)│     │(hm-deep-research)│  │(hm-synthesis)│   │ (export) │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └───────────┘     └──────────┘
```

### Stage 1: Detect (hm-detective)

**Purpose:** Understand what you are looking at before researching.

```bash
# SCAN mode — tech stack detection
# READ mode — targeted file reads
# DEEP mode — comprehensive codebase scan
```

**Output:** `.tech-registry.json` + initial findings

### Stage 2: Research (hm-deep-research)

**Purpose:** Gather evidence using version-matched documentation and MCP tools.

```bash
# Context7 for API verification
# Tavily for current information
# Repomix for codebase structure
```

**Output:** Structured findings with citations

### Stage 3: Synthesize (hm-synthesis)

**Purpose:** Compress findings into actionable artifacts.

```bash
# Compression tiers: Snapshot → Focused → Signature
# Artifact export: markdown, JSON, or plan files
```

**Output:** Final artifact (report, plan, or specification)

## When to Use the Full Chain

| Situation | Use Chain? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Exploring an unfamiliar codebase | Yes — full chain |
| Verifying a single API signature | No — Context7 only |
| Writing a project specification | Yes — full chain |
| Quick bug investigation | Partial — detect + research, skip synthesis |
| Producing a migration plan | Yes — full chain |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **The Skipped Detect** | Jumps straight to research without scanning | Always run hm-detective SCAN first |
| **The Hoarder** | Gathers 50 sources but never synthesizes | Cap research time, force synthesis stage |
| **The Single-Source** | Uses only one tool (e.g., only web search) | Use the full MCP matrix |
| **The Orphan Artifact** | Produces artifact but never links to source evidence | Every claim in artifact must cite source |

## Reference Map

| File | When to Read |
|------|-------------|
| `references/chain-stages.md` | Detailed stage contracts and handoff formats |
| `references/tool-matrix.md` | Which MCP tool to use for which research question |

## Cross-References

| Related Skill | Boundary |
|---------------|----------|
| `hm-detective` | Stage 1 — detection and scanning. This skill orchestrates the full chain. |
| `hm-deep-research` | Stage 2 — evidence gathering. This skill ensures it feeds into synthesis. |
| `hm-synthesis` | Stage 3 — compression and artifact export. This skill triggers it at the right time. |
