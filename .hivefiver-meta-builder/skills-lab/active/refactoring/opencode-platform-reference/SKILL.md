## Key Composition Patterns

### Permission Cascading
Global config → Agent config → Session overrides → Runtime approvals. Last matching rule wins via `findLast()`.

### Tool Hook Pipeline
1. Plugin `tool.execute.before` → mutates args
2. Agent permission check (ctx.ask()) → can block
3. Tool execute → actual logic
4. Plugin `tool.execute.after` → mutates output

### Agent-Skill Two-Phase Loading
Phase 1: Skill names+descriptions in system prompt (auto)
Phase 2: Full SKILL.md content loaded on-demand via skill tool

### Subtask Spawning
Commands with subtask:true create SubtaskPart → child session → inherits target agent config + restricted tools (no task, no todowrite by default)

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Detection | Correction |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **The Memorizer** | Tries to memorize all 20 reference files | Use progressive disclosure. Read only the reference needed for the current task. |
| **The Outdated Citer** | Cites reference content as current runtime truth | References describe platform capabilities, not current project state. Verify against actual config. |
| **The Over-Loader** | Loads all 20 references at once | Load only the specific reference file needed. SKILL.md is the index, not the content. |
| **The Assumer** | Assumes platform behavior from training knowledge | Always verify via `context7` or live platform inspection before claiming platform behavior. |

## Cross-References

| Related Skill | Boundary |
|---------------|----------|
| `command-dev` | command-dev = how to write OpenCode commands. This skill = what commands/platform features exist. |
| `opencode-non-interactive-shell` | non-interactive-shell = shell safety rules. This skill = platform capability reference. |
| `meta-builder` | meta-builder routes to this skill for platform lookups. This skill provides the actual reference content. |
