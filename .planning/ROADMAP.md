# Hivemind — Roadmap

**Created:** 2026-05-07  
**Status:** Active  
**Dependency order:** Phase 0 Governance Baseline → Bootstrap/Init CLI → Shell/PTY Control-Plane Runway → Meta-Concept Migration → Routing Foundation → Agent Workflows → User Experience

---

## Phase 0 — Governance Baseline (Blocking Entry Gate)

Phase 0 is the current blocking gate before BOOT, MCM, and f-04 continuation. It is docs/governance only and produces L5 evidence. It does not authorize runtime code moves, `.opencode/` primitive edits, `.hivemind/` state edits, package changes, tests, or commits.

| Phase | Title | Status | Depends On | Blocks |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| P0-01 | Runtime Identity Taxonomy | ✅ COMPLETE | Source evidence inspection | BOOT, MCM, f-04 |
| P0-02 | Source Plane Architecture | ✅ COMPLETE | P0-01 | BOOT, f-04, source refactors |
| P0-03 | Config Contract | ✅ COMPLETE | P0-01 | BOOT config, MCM config integration |
| P0-04 | HiveFiver Meta-Authoring Architecture | ✅ COMPLETE | P0-01 | MCM and HF command families |
| P0-05 | Phase 0 Governance Gate | ✅ COMPLETE | P0-01..P0-04 | All downstream continuation |
| P0-06 | Phase 0 Route/State Update | ✅ COMPLETE | P0-05 | BOOT/MCM/f-04 routing |

### Phase 0 Canonical Naming

| Concept | Canonical value |
|---|---|
| Product | Hivemind |
| Package/bin | `hivemind` |
| Project type | harness |
| Platform | OpenCode |
| Legacy aliases | `opencode-harness`, `hivemind-tools` only when explicitly labeled legacy |
| Internal workflow tooling | GSD, not product identity |

### Phase 0 Artifacts

- `.planning/architecture/hivemind-runtime-identity-taxonomy-2026-05-07.md`
- `.planning/architecture/hivemind-source-plane-architecture-2026-05-07.md`
- `.planning/config/hivemind-config-contract-2026-05-07.md`
- `.planning/architecture/hivefiver-meta-authoring-architecture-2026-05-07.md`
- `.planning/checklists/phase-0-governance-gate-2026-05-07.md`
- `.planning/roadmap/phase-0-gsd-route-2026-05-07.md`

Gate boundary: Phase 0 artifacts are L5 documentation/governance evidence. Runtime readiness remains FAIL/BLOCK until L1-L3 proof exists in later authorized phases.

## Active Workstream: Core Architecture (WS-CA)

| Phase | Title | Status | Depends On |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| CA-01 | configs.json Schema + Runtime Binding | ✅ DELIVERED | — |
| CA-02 | Behavioral Profile System + Mode Dispatch | ✅ DELIVERED | CA-01 |
| CA-03 | Workflow Toggle Runtime Binding | ✅ DELIVERED | CA-01 |
| CA-04 | **Bootstrap + State Ownership** (restructured) | 🔴 IN PROGRESS (Phase 0 gate passed) | CA-01, CA-02, CA-03 |

### CA-04 Restructured Scope

Original "CRUD Ownership Modules + Lifecycle Verification" was premature — building plumbing before producers/consumers exist. Restructured to priority-ordered sub-phases:

| Sub-phase | Title | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| CA-04.1 | **Bootstrap CLI + Primitives Recovery** | D-CRUD-01: `npx hivemind init` creates `.hivemind/` + `.opencode/` structure. Postinstall restores primitives. Legacy alias: `npx opencode-harness init`. Fixes the "delete and lose everything" gap. |
| CA-04.2 | **Config Consumer Runtime Wiring** | D-BIND-03: Config fields must have verified consumers. `conversation_language` is traced as wired in L5 config traceability; `delegation_systems` remains without a verified runtime consumer. Fix or explicitly defer the remaining config → behavior gaps. |
| CA-04.3 | **State Directory Ownership Modules** | D-CRUD-05: Each `.hivemind/` subdirectory gets typed module. Tiered by mutation need (7 CRUD, 7 append, 6 read-only). Only AFTER bootstrap exists and tools write state. |
| CA-04.4 | **Lifecycle Audit + Gate Criteria Synthesis** | Synthesize gate-l3-lifecycle-integration references/ from ARCHITECTURE.md. Audit all 34 src/lib modules. Fix only CA-04 CRUD-owner violations. |

### Option 3 — Sector Governance Foundation (Docs-Only Route)

Option 3 is a new docs-only foundation route layered onto CA-04 governance work. It does **not** replace CA-04 and does **not** claim runtime implementation readiness.

| Phase | Title | Status | Depends On |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| O3-01 | OMO Architecture Adaptation Research / Context Alignment | ✅ DOCS-ONLY FOUNDATION | CA-04 context |
| O3-02 | Hivemind Sector AGENTS.md Target Architecture | ✅ DOCS-ONLY FOUNDATION | O3-01 |
| O3-03 | Command vs Workflow vs Session/Task Continuity Map | ✅ DOCS-ONLY FOUNDATION | O3-01 |
| O3-04 | Sector AGENTS.md Docs Implementation | ✅ DELIVERED (9 sector AGENTS.md, lifecycle+spec PASS, evidence DUAL) | O3-01, O3-02, O3-03, pre-phase checklist pass |

Option 3 implementation phases (in dependency order):

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Sector AGENTS.md docs | ✅ DELIVERED (O3-04, 9 files committed) |
| 2 | Config realm cleanup | ✅ DELIVERED (traceability doc, dead code removed) |
| 3 | **Bootstrap/init CLI** | 🔴 IN PROGRESS — see BOOT workstream below; Phase 0 gate passed |
| 4 | Routing workflow foundation | ⬜ PENDING — f-04, blocked until Phase 0 + bootstrap complete |
| 5 | Session/task continuity management | ⬜ PENDING — blocked until typed owners + E2E proof |

Gate boundary: docs-only artifacts are L5 evidence. Runtime readiness: FAIL/BLOCK until L1-L3 runtime proof exists.

---

## Active Workstream: Bootstrap & Init CLI (WS-BOOT)

The Bootstrap CLI is a proper CLI toolbelt — not just `mkdir` + symlink. It provides project initialization, state recovery, primitives restoration, health checking, and rich terminal feedback. Phase 0 governance gate PASSED. BOOT-02 implementation summaries now require BOOT-02R governance reconciliation before BOOT-03 automation resumes. The package/bin identity is `hivemind`; `opencode-harness` and `hivemind-tools` are legacy aliases only.

| Phase | Title | Status | Depends On | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| BOOT-01 | Dependency Audit + Architecture | ✅ COMPLETE | — | L5 research docs |
| BOOT-02 | CLI Framework + Entry Point | 🟡 IMPLEMENTED IN WORKTREE — reconciliation active | BOOT-01 | L3: `npx hivemind --help` works; summary evidence reconciled by BOOT-02R |
| BOOT-02R | Governance Reconciliation | 🔵 READY — docs/governance only | BOOT-02 summary evidence | L5: ROADMAP/STATE/REQUIREMENTS agree on BOOT status |
| BOOT-03 | State Init (.hivemind/ creation) | ⬜ PENDING | BOOT-02R | L3: `npx hivemind init` creates structure |
| BOOT-04 | Primitives Recovery (.opencode/) | ⬜ PENDING | BOOT-02 | L3: symlinks restored from `.hivefiver-meta-builder/` |
| BOOT-05 | Config Bootstrap + Defaults | ⬜ PENDING | BOOT-02 | L3: configs.json initialized with defaults |
| BOOT-06 | Validation + Health Check | ⬜ PENDING | BOOT-03, BOOT-04, BOOT-05 | L2: `npx hivemind doctor` PASS |
| BOOT-07 | End-to-End Proof | ⬜ PENDING | BOOT-06 | L1: nuke `.hivemind/` + `init` → all gates pass |
| BOOT-08 | Agent + Skill Integration | ⬜ PENDING | BOOT-07 | L5: constitution + routing contracts |

### Shell / PTY Control-Plane Runway

The shell/PTY/background command lane is real and cross-cutting across `run-background-command`, PTY adapters, command delegation, SDK delegation, tool guards, lifecycle events, and future sidecar/tmux projection. It is not part of BOOT-02 runtime scope. The safe route is a docs/spec spike now and implementation only after BOOT-07 or explicit higher-risk authorization.

| Phase | Title | Status | Depends On | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| CP-PTY-00 | Shell / PTY Control-Plane Spike | 🔵 READY — docs/spec only; may run in parallel with BOOT-03..05 | BOOT-02R | L5: context, research, requirements, spec, route artifacts |
| CP-PTY-01 | Background Shell Control-Plane MVP | ⛔ BLOCKED | CP-PTY-00, BOOT-07 unless explicitly authorized earlier | L2-L3: permission-gated command lifecycle tests; L1 preferred E2E proof |
| SC-PTY-01 | Read-Only Terminal Projection | ⬜ DEFERRED | CP-PTY-01, Q2 sidecar decision confirmation | L2-L3: read-only projection proof |

### BOOT-01 Scope: Research & Architecture Decision

Before writing code:

1. **OpenCode ecosystem synthesis** — investigate `opencode-pty`, `opencode-background-agents`, `awesome-opencode` directory, `opencode-dynamic-context-pruning` for patterns. Adapt toward Hivemind's CQRS/tool-hook lifecycle. Do NOT blindly copy OMO folder structure or GSD conventions.
2. **Dependency reconciliation** — map each new `package.json` dependency to a concrete Bootstrap CLI feature. Justify every dependency with a Hivemind-native use case.
3. **Grey area clearance** — surface architecture decisions: CLI framework (commander vs. alternative), primitives parsing strategy (gray-matter + yaml vs. unified parser), AST integration scope, MCP server boundaries, PTY ownership.
4. **Output:** research docs in `.planning/research/` (date-stamped), grey-area decision matrix, dependency-to-feature map.

### BOOT-02 Scope: CLI Entry Point

- Wire `commander` CLI framework with program/subcommand structure
- Integrate `@clack/prompts` for interactive flows
- Rich terminal output via `ink`/`react` (optional, deferrable)
- Export path: `./cli` in package.json → `src/cli/index.ts`
- Bin entry: `hivemind`; `hivemind-tools` is a legacy alias only

### BOOT-03 Scope: State Initialization

- `npx hivemind init` creates canonical `.hivemind/` directory tree
- 19 subdirectories with `.gitkeep` registration
- Typed CRUD modules per `.hivemind/` subdirectory (7 CRUD, 7 append, 6 read-only)
- Fixes D-CRUD-05 gap

### BOOT-04 Scope: Primitives Recovery

- Restore `.opencode/` symlinks to `.hivefiver-meta-builder/` source
- Validation: walk `.hivefiver-meta-builder/` → verify every expected `.opencode/` symlink
- Fixes D-CRUD-01: "delete and lose everything" gap

### BOOT-05 Scope: Config Bootstrap

- Initialize `.hivemind/configs.json` from schema defaults
- Validate against `hivemind-configs.schema.ts`
- Wire to behavioral-profile + governance-block consumers

### BOOT-06 Scope: Validation

- `npx hivemind doctor` — full health check
- Checks: `.hivemind/` structure integrity, `.opencode/` symlinks, config validity, SDK availability, typecheck, test pass, module count
- Human-readable report with PASS/FAIL/WARN verdicts

### BOOT-07 Scope: End-to-End Proof

- Nuke `.hivemind/` → run `init` → verify: (a) structure created, (b) symlinks restored, (c) configs initialized, (d) doctor returns PASS, (e) typecheck passes, (f) 1767 tests pass
- This is L1 runtime evidence — closes the docs-only gate

### Checkpoints

- **CP-CA-1:** configs.json full schema operational ✅
- **CP-CA-2:** Mode → behavioral profile mapping produces observable behavior ✅
- **CP-CA-3:** Every workflow toggle has a concrete runtime consumer ✅ (6 wired, 4 annotated, 4 deferred)
- **CP-CA-4:** `.hivemind/` bootstrap on install + typed ownership for state/ and delegation-managements/ dirs (MINIMUM)

---

## Active Workstream: Harness Ecosystem Recovery (HER)

| Phase | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| HER-0 | Ecosystem Remap Audit | ✅ VALUABLE-CONTEXT |
| HER-1 | Documentation & Config Recovery | ✅ DELIVERED |
| HER-2 | Dead Code Cleanup | ✅ DELIVERED |
| HER-3 | Context & Compaction | 📋 READY — no PLAN.md |
| HER-4 | SDK Integration Depth | 📋 READY — no PLAN.md |
| HER-5 | Agent Rationalization | 📋 READY — no PLAN.md |

---

## Active Workstream: Meta-Concept Migration (WS-MCM)

The meta-concept migration workstream ports hm-*, hf-*, gate-*, and stack-* agents and skills from `.hivefiver-meta-builder/` (the developer workspace) into `.opencode/` (shipped project primitives), integrates them into config planes, doctor workflows, and end-user customization surfaces. MCM continuation is blocked until the Phase 0 governance gate passes. GSD-prefixed agents/skills are excluded — those are internal dev tooling only and never shipped as Hivemind product primitives.

### Source inventory

- **Agents lab:** `.hivefiver-meta-builder/agents-lab/active/refactoring/` — current active inventory has 89 agent definitions. MCM doctor must classify shipped vs dev-only before migration.
- **Skills lab:** `.hivefiver-meta-builder/skills-lab/active/refactoring/` — current active inventory has 123 skill directories, excluding `.gitkeep`. MCM doctor must classify shipped vs dev-only before migration.
- **Total source:** `.hivefiver-meta-builder/` includes active labs plus commands-lab, plans, references-lab, research, and rules subdirectories. Exact file counts are MCM doctor evidence, not Phase 0 evidence.

| Phase | Title | Status | Depends On | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| MCM-01 | Agent Migration to .opencode/ | ⬜ BLOCKED BY PHASE 0 | BOOT-04 (symlinks exist), Phase 0 gate | L3: MCM doctor classifies hm-/hf-eligible agents and verifies discoverability in `.opencode/agents/` |
| MCM-02 | Skill Migration to .opencode/ | ⬜ BLOCKED BY PHASE 0 | BOOT-04 (symlinks exist), Phase 0 gate | L3: MCM doctor classifies hm-/hf-/gate-/stack-eligible skills and verifies discoverability in `.opencode/skills/` |
| MCM-03 | Config Plane Integration | ⬜ BLOCKED BY PHASE 0 | MCM-01, MCM-02, BOOT-06, Phase 0 gate | L2: doctor reports agent/skill counts, config validation includes meta-concept checks |
| MCM-04 | End-User Customization + Ecosystem Integration | ⬜ BLOCKED BY PHASE 0 | MCM-03, Phase 0 gate | L2: end-user projects can customize shipped primitives via config, OpenCode SDK/API integration verified |

### MCM-01 Scope: Agent Migration

- Classify active agent definitions from `.hivefiver-meta-builder/agents-lab/active/refactoring/` before copying or reflecting into `.opencode/agents/`
- Exclude: all `gsd-*` prefixed agents — these are dev tooling
- Include only hm-/hf-eligible agents after MCM doctor confirms lineage, permissions, and discoverability expectations
- Validate each agent has correct frontmatter, tools permissions, temperature settings
- Verify all migrated agents are discoverable by OpenCode runtime

### MCM-02 Scope: Skill Migration

- Classify active skill directories from `.hivefiver-meta-builder/skills-lab/active/refactoring/` before copying or reflecting into `.opencode/skills/`
- Exclude: all `gsd-*` prefixed skills unless explicitly retained as internal developer tooling outside the shipped Hivemind primitive set
- Include only hm-/hf-/gate-/stack-eligible skills after MCM doctor confirms lineage, trigger, and discoverability expectations
- Validate each skill has correct SKILL.md structure, trigger phrases
- Verify all migrated skills are discoverable by OpenCode runtime

### MCM-03 Scope: Config + Doctor Integration

- Add agent/skill count checks to doctor command (BOOT-06 extension)
- Add meta-concept validation to config plane: verify shipped primitives are present and valid
- Wire agent/skill registries into config assets plane
- Doctor reports: agent count, skill count, missing/broken references

### MCM-04 Scope: Customization + Ecosystem

- End-user project meta concept customization via `.hivemind/` config
- Documentation for extending/replacing shipped primitives
- OpenCode SDK/API/plugin interface verification with shipped agents/skills
- Hivemind engine integration contracts validated against shipped primitives

## Planned Workstreams (Blocked on Core Architecture)

### Agent Workflows (WS-AW)
- WS-4: Auto-commands + Workflow Router (f-04) — **HIGHEST GAP**, blocked by Phase 0 + BOOT + MCM
- WS-5: Delegation Revamp (f-06 lanes/hierarchy)
- WS-6: Trajectory + Task-Plus (f-07)

### User Experience (WS-UX)
- WS-2: Bootstrap CLI + Onboarding
- WS-7: Context/Compaction Engine
- WS-8: Sidecar + UI (DEFERRED)

## Deliverables & Timeline

| Wave | What | Blocks |
|------|------|--------|
| **Wave 0 (NOW)** | Phase 0 Governance Baseline | Blocks BOOT/MCM/f-04 until gate passes |
| **Wave 1** | BOOT-01 Research + BOOT-02 CLI Framework + BOOT-02R Governance Reconciliation | Depends on Phase 0 gate |
| **Wave 2** | BOOT-03 State Init + BOOT-04 Primitives + BOOT-05 Config; CP-PTY-00 docs/spec spike may run in parallel | Depends on Phase 0 + Wave 1 CLI framework/reconciliation |
| **Wave 3** | BOOT-06 Validation + BOOT-07 E2E Proof | Depends on Phase 0 + Waves 1-2 |
| **Wave 3.5** | CP-PTY-01 Background Shell Control-Plane MVP if routing requires command lanes | Depends on CP-PTY-00 + BOOT-07 unless explicitly authorized earlier |
| **Wave 4** | MCM-01 Agent Migration + MCM-02 Skill Migration | Depends on Phase 0 + BOOT-04 (symlinks exist) |
| **Wave 5** | MCM-03 Config Integration + MCM-04 Customization | Depends on Phase 0 + Wave 4 + BOOT-06 |
| **Wave 6** | f-04 Auto-commands + Workflow Router | Depends on Phase 0 + BOOT + MCM; also depends on CP-PTY-00/01 if router invokes command lanes |
| **Wave 7** | HER-3/4/5 execution | Depends on Wave 6 routing |
| **Wave 8+** | WS-AW + WS-UX workstreams | Depends on Waves 1-7 |

---

## Managed Autonomous Loop

Execution now follows the managed autonomous loop described in `.planning/roadmap/managed-autonomous-loop-2026-05-07.md`.

Rules:

- Only one workflow cycle may run per user authorization.
- Each cycle must have an entry gate, plan gate, execution gate, review gate, and exit gate.
- Broad autonomy is blocked until bootstrap recovery, config-to-behavior wiring, f-04 routing, hierarchy enforcement, and E2E proof are complete.
- Cycle 1 — Lifecycle Alignment: ✅ COMPLETE (O3 docs + sector AGENTS.md + config cleanup)
- Current authorized cycle: **Cycle 2 — Bootstrap Recovery + BOOT-02R reconciliation** (Phase 0 gate PASSED, BOOT-02 implementation summaries exist, status reconciliation active).
- Parallel docs/spec lane: **CP-PTY-00 Shell / PTY Control-Plane Spike** (L5 only; no runtime mutation).
- Current blocking gate: **BOOT-02R Governance Reconciliation** before BOOT-03 automation resumes.
- MCM continuation pending BOOT-04 symlinks.
- Next recommended cycle: **Cycle 3 — Routing Foundation**.
