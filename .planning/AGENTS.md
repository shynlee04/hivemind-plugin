# Planning and Governance Sector Guidance

**Evidence level:** L5 documentation guidance only. This file does not prove runtime readiness; runtime claims require L1-L3 proof from authorized verification workflows.

## 1. Sector purpose and lifecycle role

`.planning/` is the Planning/Governance sector for source-backed requirements, roadmaps, architecture maps, audits, research, lifecycle notes, and phase authorization artifacts. It explains and gates work; it does not implement runtime behavior. Source evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:29-49`, `.planning/architecture/sector-agents-docs-implementation-plan-2026-05-07.md:12-15`, `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:73-79`.

## 2. Allowed mutation authority

- Planning artifacts may document requirements, acceptance matrices, target architecture, audits, roadmaps, and source-backed decisions.
- Planning artifacts may authorize future work only when they explicitly state scope, dependencies, evidence requirements, and gate conditions. Evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:29-49`.
- Date-stamped artifacts are expected for generated plans, reports, and architecture documents when creating new governance outputs.

## 3. Forbidden mutations / explicit no-go boundaries

- Planning docs SHALL NOT claim runtime readiness from docs-only evidence. Evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:47-49`, `.planning/architecture/sector-agents-docs-implementation-plan-2026-05-07.md:1-8`.
- Planning docs SHALL NOT authorize runtime code, `.opencode/**` primitive, or `.hivemind/**` state mutation unless the current phase/user authorization explicitly allows it. Evidence: `.planning/architecture/sector-agents-docs-implementation-plan-2026-05-07.md:12-15`.
- Do not blindly copy OMO or adopt OMO roots; sector mapping must preserve Hivemind surfaces. Evidence: `.planning/architecture/hivemind-sector-agents-target-2026-05-07.md:28-37`.
- Do not treat archived planning artifacts as current authority without a fresh date/status check.

## 4. Actors and consumers

| Actor / consumer | Uses this sector for | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Coordinators and specialists | Source contracts, acceptance criteria, gate status, and phase boundaries | Must not infer implementation authorization from drafts |
| Quality gates | Trace requirements to evidence and readiness claims | Docs-only artifacts are L5 unless runtime proof is attached |
| Runtime/source sectors | Consume approved requirements and architecture constraints | Implementation occurs outside `.planning/` |
| Human reviewers | Decide authorization and priority | Planning can recommend but not self-approve runtime readiness |

## 5. Naming and placement conventions

- Generated artifacts should be grouped by purpose (`architecture/`, `research/`, `audits/`, `checklists/`, `roadmap/`, `lifecycle/`) and date-stamped with `name-YYYY-MM-DD` where applicable.
- Current codebase intelligence lives under `.planning/codebase/`; active roadmap/requirements/project state live at `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.planning/PROJECT.md`, and `.planning/STATE.md`. Evidence: `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md:73-79`.
- Archived artifacts under `.planning/archive/` require current validation before use as authority.

## 6. Quality gates and evidence expectations

- Planning requirements should be falsifiable, source-backed, and mapped to acceptance/verification methods.
- Completion claims must state evidence level; O3 and docs-only artifacts are L5 and keep runtime readiness blocked. Evidence: `.planning/ROADMAP.md:47-49`.
- Before a planning artifact authorizes work, it must identify allowed surfaces, forbidden surfaces, actors/consumers, verification commands or inspection methods, and stop conditions.
