# GSD Lifecycle Map (Compatibility Layer)

- project -> business objective and top-level success metrics
- milestone -> major deliverable checkpoints
- phase -> bounded execution segment and gates
- plan -> tactical strategy and sequencing
- task -> implementation unit with owner and evidence
- verification -> exit-gate proof and acceptance trace

## Lineage Rule
Each level must reference its direct parent to avoid orphan execution.
