# Domain Pack Matrix

| Domain Pack | Primary Outputs | Typical Workflows | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dev | specs, architecture, implementation handoff | spec -> research -> build -> validate | default engineering lane |
| marketing | campaign plan, audience matrix, content ops plan | intake -> research -> workflow -> validate | preserve brand/compliance guardrails |
| finance | forecast models, KPI packs, report narratives | intake -> research -> validate -> deploy | enforce evidence confidence tags |
| office-ops | docs, spreadsheets, slides, executive reports | intake -> architect -> workflow -> validate | blueprint delivery, no forced API runtime |
| hybrid | cross-domain execution map | intake -> spec -> research -> workflow -> validate | include lane merge logic |

## Router Rules
1. Preserve governance gates regardless of domain.
2. If evidence is partial, force explicit caveats in deliverables.
3. Keep all outputs traceable to task and requirement nodes.
