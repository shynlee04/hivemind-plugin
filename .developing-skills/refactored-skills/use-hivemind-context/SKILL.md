## Load Position

**Slot: 2 (Domain — context health)**. `use-hivemind` is always loaded first.

| Constraint | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Stack position | Slot 2 of 3 |
| Load order | After `use-hivemind` |
| Max active | 3 skills total |
| Conflict | Cannot co-load with another domain router |

# use-hivemind-context

You're about to trust something — a doc, a memory, a prior session's claim, a test result. Stop. This domain router puts a checkpoint between "I remember" and "I trust." It doesn't do the checking itself. It dispatches to the right specialist based on what kind of doubt you have: session health uncertainty, or project-structural verification.

**Parent:** `use-hivemind` (Slot 1 entry router)

## When You Need This

| Signal | Route To |
|--------|----------|
| Session just resumed after interruption, compaction, or `/clear` | `context-intelligence-entry` (quick mode) |
| Something feels off — docs don't match code, memory seems stale | `context-intelligence-entry` (rot mode) |
| Need a full trust breakdown before a major decision | `context-intelligence-entry` (full mode) |
| Before starting work — baseline project health | `context-entry-verify` (gate-chain or landscape) |
| Between implementation phases — gate checkpoint | `context-entry-verify` (individual gates) |
| Validating a completion claim with hard evidence | `context-entry-verify` (gate-chain) |
| After merges, dependency changes, or long gaps | `context-entry-verify` (landscape) |

## The 3-Step Trust Check

Before routing, run this mental model. It takes five seconds and catches most problems.

1. **Freshness** — Was anything relevant written in the last 48 hours?
   - Docs, commits, session state files. If nothing is recent, your context is suspect.
2. **Code vs Docs** — Does the code match what the docs claim?
   - Open the file. Don't trust the doc's word. The code is the authority.
3. **Prior Sessions** — Is memory corroborated by git or build output?
   - If you "remember" something but git doesn't show it, the memory is wrong.

If step 1 fails → go straight to rot check. If step 2 or 3 fails → go full analysis.

## Distrust Levels

Declare the level explicitly. Don't mumble "it might be stale." Say what it is.

| Level | Meaning | What To Do |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **CLEAN** | Docs, code, and git agree. Recent commits exist. Session state is readable. | Proceed normally. |
| **SUSPECT** | One source disagrees with others, or documents are >48 hours old. | Cross-check the disagreeing source before trusting. |
| **DEGRADED** | Multiple contradictions. Session state is stale or unreadable. | Run rot check. Quarantine unverified claims. |
| **POLLUTED** | Active misinformation — docs claim things the code doesn't do, or AGENTS.md references non-existent files. | Trust-nothing mode. Verify everything from code and git. |
| **POISONED** | Session context is actively contradictory. Prior session memory conflicts with git history. | Full analysis. Emit checkpoint. Do not proceed until trust is rebuilt. |

When DEGRADED or worse, say it out loud: "Context is DEGRADED. Distrusting [specific sources] until verified."

## Routing Logic

```
Input: what's doubted?
  ├── Session health, freshness, prior memory
  │     → context-intelligence-entry
  │       ├── --quick  (fast continuity probe)
  │       ├── --rot    (deterministic PASS/FAIL gate)
  │       └── --full   (deep trust breakdown)
  │
  └── Project state, build, tests, git structure
        → context-entry-verify
          ├── gate-chain  (fail-fast sequential)
          ├── landscape   (full report, never blocks)
          └── individual  (targeted gate checks)
```

## Verification Gates (Project Reality)

When `context-entry-verify` is dispatched, these four layers run:

| Layer | What It Checks | Gate Type |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| 1. Project Reality | Build, tests, contracts, dependencies, SDK surface | Hard — blocks |
| 2. Planning Integrity | Plan files exist, reference real files, no contradictions | Hard — requires `.planning/` convention |
| 3. Git Evidence | Branch state, last commit, diff stats, merge-conflict-free | Hard — blocks |
| 4. Architecture | Domain boundaries, dead exports, circular dependencies | Soft — warnings only |

Layer 2 assumes a `.planning/` directory with `STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`. If your project doesn't use that convention, use `landscape` instead of `gate-chain` to skip meaningless failures.

## Freshness Probe

Quick checks you can run before dispatching:

- **Document age**: `find . -name "*.md" -mtime -2` — anything older than 2 days is suspect
- **Git recency**: `git log --oneline -5` — if the latest commit is days old, session memory is stale
- **Session state**: Check `.hivemind/activity/sessions/continuity.json` exists and has a recent `updated_at`
- **Test signal**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit && npm test` — if tests pass but code looks wrong, the test is lying

## Distrust Protocol

When rot is detected or after session interruption:

1. **Trust-Nothing Mode**: Treat all prior context as stale until verified from code, git, or build output. Not "mostly trustworthy." Stale.
2. **AGENTS.md Quarantine**: Verify every instruction in AGENTS.md against actual code before following it. If it references a file that doesn't exist, quarantine the instruction — don't follow it and don't delete it.
3. **False Signal Awareness**: Test output, linter results, and doc-claimed behavior must be cross-checked against implementation reality. A passing test that asserts `true === true` proves nothing.

## Orchestrator Integration

When the orchestrator's session is already heavy:

- **Quick mode** can run inline — it's lightweight enough
- **Rot and full modes** should be **delegated** to a subagent — their output can be large
- The orchestrator reads only: `rot_level`, `trust`, `can_proceed`, `recommendations`
- If rot result is DEGRADED or worse, declare distrust before routing to any other domain

## Handoff Paths

```
.hivemind/activity/state/context-check.json    ← runtime cache (not official boundary)
.hivemind/activity/codescan/                   ← scan outputs per pass
.hivemind/activity/sessions/continuity.json    ← session continuity state
```

Paths are relative to project root. Resolve via `pathing/active-paths.json`.

## Carry-Forward

After any context check completes:

- If issues were found, emit a continuity checkpoint noting what was verified and what remains uncertain
- Store it in `{project}/.hivemind/activity/sessions/` or `{project}/.hivemind/activity/state/`
- If delegation follows, include the distrust context in the delegation packet so child agents don't repeat false trust
- Compress to ≤5 key findings, blocked routes, recommended next action, output paths

## Sibling Skills

| Parent | This Skill | Depth Partners |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `use-hivemind` | `use-hivemind-context` | `context-intelligence-entry`, `context-entry-verify` |

This router consolidates: `context-intelligence-entry` (session health, rot detection, trust scoring) and `context-entry-verify` (project verification gates, build/test/git checks). Domain-specific scripts and references remain in their respective `scripts/` and `references/` directories.

## Anti-Patterns

**You assume remembered context is trustworthy.** It's not. Run a quick probe. Takes seconds, saves hours of debugging based on stale assumptions.

**You treat quick mode as sufficient for major decisions.** Quick tells you if the session is alive. It doesn't tell you if the project is healthy. Use rot or full when it matters.

**You trust a test pass without reading the assertion.** A test that asserts `expect(result).toBeDefined()` on a function that returns garbage is lying to you. Read what it actually checks.

**You follow AGENTS.md instructions that reference files you haven't confirmed exist.** If AGENTS.md says "load the skill at `skills/foo/SKILL.md`" and that path doesn't exist, the instruction is stale. Quarantine it.

**You skip the distrust declaration and just keep working.** If context is DEGRADED and you don't say so, the next agent inherits your false confidence. Declare the level. Every time.

**You run full analysis when quick mode would answer the question.** Full analysis is expensive. If you just need to know "is this session fresh?", quick mode is the right tool. Don't bring a spectrometer to check if the light is on.
