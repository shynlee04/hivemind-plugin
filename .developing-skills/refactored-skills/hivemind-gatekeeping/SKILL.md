## Load Position

Slot: 3 (Depth). Requires `use-hivemind-delegation` in Slot 2.

## When You Need This

You need this skill when your workflow loops. Not one-shot delegation — actual multi-pass iteration where each pass depends on what the last one found. Think audits that go deeper each round, debug sessions that narrow findings, research that synthesizes across passes.

Load it when any of these show up:

- A workflow has `max_iterations` and `stop_conditions`
- Parallel slices need integration verification after they return
- You need a checkpoint to track what happened across iterations
- Carry-forward compression matters because context is tight
- You're worried about cascading failures blowing up the whole pass

Don't load it for single-pass delegation — that's `use-hivemind-delegation` territory. Don't load it for domain-specific loops (TDD, debug, refactor, research) — those domain skills handle their own loop control.

## Loop Setup

Every multi-pass delegation starts with a loop checkpoint. Before you dispatch anything:

1. **Set `max_iterations`** — default 10, tighten for simple scopes, loosen for complex audits
2. **Define `stop_conditions`** — at least 2 conditions required, never fewer. Examples: "all files scanned," "no new findings in last pass," "coverage above 90%"
3. **Initialize the checkpoint** at `{activity}/delegation/{loop_id}-checkpoint.json`
4. **Set `cleanup_allowed: "no"`** — stays no while the loop is active, only the orchestrator can flip it

The checkpoint is the loop's memory. Not chat history, not your notes — the JSON file. That's what survives compaction.

## Iteration Rules

Each iteration is a contract. It must deliver:

**Carry-forward** — ≤5 items max. These are the key findings, discovered blockers, and paths to detailed output files. Not the full scan results. Those live in their own output files. The carry-forward is a compressed summary for the next iteration's context.

The rules are simple but non-negotiable:

- Read the checkpoint before deciding what the next iteration does
- Stop when any stop condition fires — never push past `max_iterations`
- If blocked, record `blocked_reason` and set `status: "blocked"`
- Never run parallel iterations — each one depends on the previous carry-forward
- If carry-forward exceeds 5 items, merge related findings until you hit the limit

## Synthesis Gates

After each iteration, output passes through a gate. No gate pass, no next iteration. Period.

### The Four Checks

| Check | Pass Condition |
|-------|----------------|
| `carry_forward_populated` | carry_forward array has 1–5 items |
| `coverage_status_updated` | coverage_status reflects actual progress, not last iteration's status |
| `no_contradictions` | findings don't contradict what prior carry-forwards said |
| `output_written` | output_path points to a file that actually exists |

### When a Gate Fails

Don't push through. Don't "fix it next iteration." Stop.

1. Set gate result to `fail` or `conditional`
2. Pause the loop — `status: "paused"`
3. Emit a gate failure report listing exactly which checks failed
4. Wait for orchestrator decision: `continue`, `pause`, or `abort`
5. Do not proceed until the gate passes

Gate results live at `{activity}/delegation/{loop_id}-gate-{iteration}.json`.

## Bead Tracking

Sometimes you need finer grain than "iteration done." Beads track file-by-file, batch-by-batch progress inside a single iteration:

```json
{
  "bead_id": "audit_batch_2",
  "total_items": 20,
  "completed": 14,
  "remaining": 6,
  "blocked": 0,
  "items": [
    { "path": "src/tools/runtime/tools.ts", "status": "done", "findings": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Use beads when an iteration touches many files and you need to know exactly where you are. Skip them for small iterations — don't over-engineer.

## Integration Verification

When parallel slices come back, you can't just merge and move on. Verify they actually work together.

1. Run integration tests against all results simultaneously
2. Check for import conflicts — same symbol, different sources
3. Check for type collisions — same type name, different definitions
4. Check for shared-state races — concurrent mutations to the same state
5. Pinpoint which specific slice caused each conflict
6. Re-delegate only the conflicting slice — don't nuke all of them

If two slices both modify `src/shared/types.ts` and produce incompatible definitions, re-delegate the one that's wrong. Don't re-run both.

## Cascading Failure

When things go wrong at scale, you need a plan.

### Parallel Collapse (>50% Fail)

Stop everything. The slices aren't the problem — the decomposition is. Reassess how you split the work before you try again.

### Same Failure, 3+ Iterations

If the same type of failure keeps showing up across iterations, the loop approach is wrong. Not the iterations — the approach. Stop the loop, escalate to the orchestrator with the failure pattern, and consider re-planning from scratch.

### Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Same slice fails twice, different errors | Re-delegate with tighter constraints |
| Same slice fails twice, same error | Re-plan — slice boundary is wrong |
| >50% parallel failure | Re-plan — decomposition is wrong |
| Iteration produces contradictions | Re-plan — loop structure is wrong |

## Anti-Patterns

**Running without max_iterations.** You're building an infinite loop. Session exhaustion is not a feature.

**Stuffing full output into carry_forward.** Context bloat kills subagents. Reference the file path instead.

**Ignoring stop conditions.** Diminishing returns produce contradictory findings. Stop when the conditions say stop.

**Starting an iteration without reading the checkpoint.** You'll duplicate work and break the evidence chain. The checkpoint exists for a reason.

**Relying on chat memory for loop state.** Compaction erases it. The checkpoint file is the only durable record.

**Re-delegating all slices on one integration failure.** Waste of resources. Isolate the conflicting slice and fix that one.

**Skipping the synthesis gate.** Gate failures exist to catch problems before they cascade. Skipping them is skipping safety.

**Running parallel iterations.** Iterations are sequential by design. Each one reads the previous carry-forward. Parallel iterations means duplicate context and conflicting decisions.

## Storage

Loop checkpoints: `{activity}/delegation/{loop_id}-checkpoint.json`
Gate results: `{activity}/delegation/{loop_id}-gate-{iteration}.json`
Scan-specific loops: `{activity}/codescan/{pass_id}/loop-checkpoint.json`
